In order to build and run this application, you are first going to need jteigen's ScalaTest plugin for Maven, which you
can find here:

    http://github.com/teigen/maven-scalatest-plugin

Just clone the repository, and then run

    mvn clean install

Then run the following commands:

    mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=backendServer (to run the backend server)
    mvn jetty:run (to run the frontend application)

After these, you're good to go.
